        <h1>Laser Communication</h1>
        <p><em>By Pooja Chugh</em></p>
        
        <p>Laser communications have been a hot topic lately, as solutions for how to satisfy ever increasing bandwidth needs are in high demand. Sharing of information through any medium is called communication. Nowadays, Lasers have become one of the worldâ€™s most important technologies.</p>
        
        <h2>What is Laser Communication?</h2>
        <p>Laser Communications Systems are wireless connections through the atmosphere. It uses Laser beams to transmit information between two locations. They work similarly to the fiber optic links, but no fibers are used as it is a wireless technology. We transfer information via laser every day, either by reading CDs and DVDs, scanning barcodes, etc. Now we use it over vast distances, through air or space.</p>
        
        <h3>Working of the Laser Communication System:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information source:</strong> The data in the audio, video, images, etc. form is converted into signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Modulator:</strong> Modulator is a device that converts the signals (information sources) to the electrical signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmitter:</strong> Transmitter is used to transmit Information signals to the receiver. It involves signal processing circuit and a laser. Laser signals are created using laser diode which includes a photodiode for the feedback to produce consistent output.</li>
            <li><strong>Receiver:</strong> Receiver receives the signal from the transmitter through the medium. Receiver involves antenna, signal processor, photon sensor (Avalanche Photodiode (APD)).</li>
            <li><strong>Demodulator:</strong> Demodulator is a device which is used to separate the information from the carrier wave and further gives it to the information sink.</li>
            <li><strong>Information Sink:</strong> Information sink collects the information and displays it in the form of audio, video, images, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Filters used in Laser communication:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Detector spectral response</li>
            <li>Shade in front of lens</li>
            <li>Sun shade over Detector</li>
            <li>Coloured Filter</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why and Where Laser Communication?</h2>
        <p>The Fiber optics and the microwaves are the most used high-speed technologies. Why do we still choose laser communication over them?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fiber optics have Installation and maintenance cost and it cannot be used in the satellite links. Whereas, the Laser communication is low cost and can be applicable at places where fiber optics are impractical to use. When compared with microwaves, Laser communication has a larger bandwidth and the laser beam width is narrower than Microwave antennas.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Applications / Where is Laser communication used?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Airports for communication across runways</li>
            <li>Aircrafts and high altitude platforms</li>
            <li>TV channels</li>
            <li>Mass communication</li>
            <li>Communicating in Defense or sensitive areas</li>
            <li>NASA and space discoveries (Satellite to Satellites, Earth to Satellites)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Advantages of Laser communication</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data rate is of up to 1.8 Gigabits per second</li>
            <li>High secure transmission possible</li>
            <li>Low bit error rates</li>
            <li>Very low installation cost</li>
            <li>Does not require wire to transfer data</li>
            <li>High bandwidth</li>
            <li>Transmission range up to 80,000 km</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Disadvantages of Laser communication</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Transmission of laser is very low in the disastrous weather such as rain, snow, or fog</li>
            <li>Pollution or smog</li>
            <li>Air influence on signal attenuation is large</li>
            <li>Atmospheric absorption</li>
            <li>Beam dispersion</li>
            <li>Physical Obstructions</li>
            <li>Interference from the background light sources (Solar radiations)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>In closing</strong></p>
        <p>Laser communication is wireless communication between two locations with the medium of air or free space. It is more secure and provides high bandwidth. It also consumes low power which is an advantage. Laser communication may soon be a boon for space exploration and it can be the most used technique worldwide in the future.</p>
