            <h1>Why Should Last Minute Studies Be Avoided?</h1>
            <p><strong>By Pooja Chugh</strong></p>

            <h2>What are last minute studies?</h2>
            <p>What do you mean by last minute studies? Last minute studies actually means starting your studies a day prior to your exam and continuing until 1-2 hours before the exam. Are you one of the students who always rely on last minute studies? Well, I was also one of them, but maybe after reading this article, you may also change your approach towards studies and exams as I did.</p>

            <h2>How does our brain work?</h2>
            <p>Our brain is simply a tissue designed to store our memory of what we learned and many other things as well. There is a process called memory consolidation, which is defined as a time-dependent process by which recently learned experiences are transformed into long-term memory, presumably by structural and chemical changes in the nervous system. Your brain stores memory as long-term memory only if it gets the repetition of memory several times. For example, all of you for sure remember the table of 2. Why so? Because since our childhood, we have used this information so many times that it has been stored in our permanent memory block. But if we take another example, like a scenario in which you have placed your purse on the kitchen table but didn't recall during the 2-hour workout, then in such a scenario, your memory will most probably not be stored as the brain will mark it as not important and you will end up searching your whole house for the purse. This makes the revision and repetition part necessary for your memory to be saved in your brain for a long time.</p>

            <h2>Reasons one should avoid last minute studies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> When you feel the need to learn a lot of information but you have no time to do so, you end up being overwhelmed with the chapters you are left with, and this causes you to feel anxious, nervous, and panicked. You are not able to sleep that night, which further makes your brain tired, and during your exam, you will find yourself in no position to focus or recall the concepts you actually learned.</li>
                <li><strong>Cramming:</strong> Cramming literally means studying intensively over a short period of time just before an examination. A day prior to exams, when you are having a pile of books in front of you, you are in no position to learn all the concepts with basic understanding; hence, you end up cramming and memorizing the concepts without knowing how to use them or what they mean.</li>
                <li><strong>Mind blanks:</strong> Mind blanks are defined as indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision, inability to let go of problems, inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling screwed or on edge. Unable to focus, or the feeling that your mind "goes blank." When you are in no state to recall anything, such states generally occur due to anxiety, panic attacks, nervousness, restlessness, and lack of sleep.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>If not last minute studies, then what?</h2>
            <p>I guess, if this question strikes your mind, this means you understood the whole concept about why we should avoid last minute studies. Last minute studies result in anxiety, panic attacks, nervousness, mind blank situations, not being able to concentrate during your exams, and a lack of understanding of concepts. Hence, the suggestion is to go for daily studies with proper study plans and guidance, repetition of concepts, scheduled revision and mock tests for your exams, note making, and practicing all the concepts thoroughly. These are the only keys that will actually help you to clear your exams with good marks.</p>
